## Formatting

This project is using [CSharpier](https://csharpier.com/), an opinionated code formatter.

### Command line

You can install it on your machine via `dotnet tool`.

```sh
# Run this command at the root of the project
dotnet tool install csharpier
```

You can then use it as a cli:

```sh
dotnet csharpier .
```

The list of command-line options is available here: https://csharpier.com/docs/CLI

### IDE integration

CSharpier supports [multiple code editors](https://csharpier.com/docs/Editors), including Visual Studio, Jetbrains Rider, VSCode and Neovim. You will be able to run format on file save after configuring the settings in your IDE. 

## Testing

This project was written following testing best practices:

- TDD, leveraging:
  - clean code/architecture
  - regression testing
  - adding new features and tests easily
- a vast majority of tests are integration tests, ensuring compatibility with a concrete SurrealDB version
- each integration test is using a separate SurrealDB namespace/database

Unit/Integration tests are written using [TUnit](https://thomhurst.github.io/TUnit/) and [FluentAssertions](https://fluentassertions.com/).

You will need a local SurrealDB instance alongside the tests. Start one using the following command:

```sh
surreal start --log debug --user root --pass root memory --allow-guests
```

Due to the asynchronous nature of Live Queries, they are tested against a separate project named `SurrealDb.Net.LiveQuery.Tests`. Where the default test project allow full parallelization, this project completely disable test parallelization. To execute tests on Live Queries, go to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

```sh
dotnet watch test --project SurrealDb.Net.LiveQuery.Tests
```

Note: Because Live Query tests are not run in parallel, it can take quite some time to run all tests.
